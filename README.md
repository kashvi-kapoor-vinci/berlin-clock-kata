## **Project Description:**
The Berlin Clock Kata involves converting a given time (hh:mm:ss) into a visual representation using colored lamps. Each line of the clock represents a part of the time (seconds, minutes, hours). The project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, where each feature is implemented step by step after writing a test.
